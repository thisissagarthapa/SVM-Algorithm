# Support Vector Machine (SVM) - School Data Classification

This repository contains a simple project that demonstrates how to use **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to classify student data based on their exam scores and attendance to predict whether they pass or fail.

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to classify student outcomes based on their **Exam Score** and **Attendance** using a dataset called `school_data.csv`. The goal is to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on the input features.

Key Steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Training the SVM model using a linear kernel
3. Visualizing the decision boundary of the classifier
4. Evaluating model performance
